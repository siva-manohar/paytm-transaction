Linux is an operating system. ---> 60% of your cloud is done

1. Security level is higher than the windows
2. User interface

Interface:

1. GUI ---> graphical user interface

2. CLI ---> command line interface

If you download the GUI, it will be available of both GUI and CLI

***Note: When it comes to the cloud there is no graphical user interface, you will be working on the only command line interface

by default any Linux operating system will have 2 users:

1. root user = super user = sudo user ---> username ="root"

2. Distribution user

Linux distributions:

1. Ubuntu ----> username: "ubuntu"

2. Redhat ---> username: "ec2_user"

3. Amazon Linux ---> username: "ec2_user"

4. SUSE ---> username: "suse_linux"

5. Parrot OS


ubuntu@ip-172-31-38-21:~$

username@ADDRESS_OF_THE_MACHINE

Linux global Commands:

1. pwd = present working directory


directory (Linux) = folder (windows)

2. ls = list of files or directory listing 

3. ls -la = listing out the files including hidden files

4. cd DIRECTORY_NAME  ---> change directory

5. cd .. ---> it will take you one step backwards

6. mkdir DIRECTORY_NAME --> mkdir = make directory. it will create a new directory

7. clear ---> clear your workspace

8. How to create the file ?

option-1: where you can create file first ( which is empty ) and then you can edit later.

	command: touch FILE_NAME

	How to create the multiple files together ?

	command: touch FILE_NAME-{1..25}

option-2: where you can create the file and write/insert the data at a time

	example: echo "This is the second option for the creating of the file" > siva-devops


option-3: Editors ---> where you will entering the data first then save it later

	Popular editors in Linux OS: "VIM" and "NANO"

	nano editor: 

		command: nano FILE_NAME
	

10.  How to verify the data is successfully created inside the file ?

16. How to create a users ?

*** where you can see the list of users and their data in the Linux OS ??

Ans: /etc/passwd

Inside the file, users data will be stored like below:

vinay:x:1001:1001::/home/vinay:/bin/sh

username:password:user_id(UID):group_id(GID):COMMENTS:PATH_OF_THE_USER:EXECUTION_MODEL

17. Password for the user:

	passwd USER_NAME

18. How to create a group ?

*** where you can see the list of groups and their data in the Linux OS ??
	
Ans: /etc/group

	devops:x:1003:vinay

	GROUP_NAME:PASSWORD:Group_ID(GID):USERS_IN_THE_GROUP

19. How to add users to the group ?

	command: usermod -aG GROUP_NAME USERNAME

20. How to remove the users from the group ?

	command: gpasswd -d USERNAME GROUP_NAME

21. How to delete the user ?

	command: userdel USERNAME

22. How to delete the group ?

23. FILE Permissions:

There will be 10 letters on the file permissions:

d rwxrwxr-x  ---> directory/folder

- rw-rw-r--  ---> file

d rwxrwxr-x  ---> directory/folder


r = read = 4 points
w = write = 2 points
x = execute = 1 point
- = null = 0 points

1    2   3
rwx rwx r-x
rw- rw- r--
rwx rwx r-x

1st part: The permissions of the user who created the file/directory = owner

2nd part: It is the permissions to the group = group

3rd part: It is the permissions to the others = others


1st:part		2nd:part		3rd:part
r	w	x	r	w	x	r	-	x
4 + 2 + 1		4 + 2 + 1		4 + 0 + 1
7			7			5


775

After fight:

1st:part		2nd:part		3rd:part
r	w	x	r	-	-	r	-	-
4 + 2 + 1		4 + 0 + 0		4 + 0 + 0
7			4			4

24. Changed ownership 

	command: chown DESIRED_USERNAME:DESIRED_GROUP  FILE_NAME

25. CPU memory utilization:
	
	command: htop
	
	command: free -m 

26. disk utilization

	command: df -h ( df = diskfree )
